# Backupbot
Backupbot is a serverbot spin-off. The functionality first was planned for serverbot, but later we decided it would be better to separate main use-cases (e.g. 'monitoring' and 'backup') in seperate projects.

# Planned features
* Easy to understand and simplistic.
* Small in size (no thousands of lines of code).
* Compatible with a broad spectrum of linux distributions.
* Flexible and configurable backup of files, directories, containers (LXD and/or Docker) etc.
* Restore backups where automatic restoration is possible.
* Notifications via cli, email and Telegram.

If you have more ideas, let me know.
